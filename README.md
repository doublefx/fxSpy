#### fxSpy 1.4

Inspect, edit and monitor your Flex application's components properties and styles.

This is a port of the [original version](https://code.google.com/p/fxspy/) for Flex 4.x SDKs (works as well on 2/3 or in compatibility mode, has been tested with custom PopPuManager where all the display list and popups belong a particular container too).
The code is released under [WTFPL](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/)

Check it out [live demo](http://www.mieuxcoder.com/data/2007/12/FlexSpy-1.2/dashboard.html) (in the application, click the flexSpy button on the top-right corner)

fxSpy allow you to inspect and dynamically change most properties and styles of the visual components in your Flex application. You can - for example - try out a specific width or a background color for your component before changing it in your code.

To install it in your application, follow the [Installation Instructions](https://code.google.com/p/fxspy/wiki/InstallationInstructions).
